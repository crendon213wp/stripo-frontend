# Stripo Framework

This is a small app for working with the Stripo email editor.

It does two useful things:

- Starts the Stripo editor in your browser.
- Creates a new project beside the `Master File` directory.
- Saves project HTML and CSS so you can reopen the work later.

The app needs Node.js, Stripo credentials, and a reliable internet connection. The internet connection matters because the editor and authentication service are hosted by Stripo.

> **Important:** Create a [Stripo.email account](https://stripo.email/) before setting up this application. The app depends on Stripo authentication and will not work until you have an account.

## Before you begin

Install these first:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- Git
- A Stripo.email account
- A Stripo Plugin ID
- A Stripo Secret Key

## Design system

The single-page website uses a small typography system so each kind of content has a clear role:

- **Space Grotesk** is the brand and display font. It is used for the logo, large section headings, and card headings.
- **Merriweather** is the reading font. It is used for descriptive paragraphs and longer explanatory copy.
- **Barlow** is the utility font. It is used for navigation, labels, buttons, metadata, numbers, and interface details.
- **Montserrat** is included in the framework typography helpers as an available example font. It is not the primary font for the current single-page design, but it can be used for future components through the existing typography classes.

The visual palette follows an acai-inspired triadic art direction:

- **Acai purple `#4D2A60`** is the primary color for strong surfaces, headings, and the framework identity.
- **Moss brown `#7A654C`** is the warm complement used for accents, labels, and supporting emphasis.
- **Mint green `#A8D5BA`** is the fresh highlight used for setup areas, icons, status details, and contrast against the purple.

Soft paper, cream, and lavender-gray neutrals support the triad so the page remains readable and the three main colors do not compete with one another.

## 1. Download the project

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crendon213wp/master_stripo_file.git
cd master_stripo_file
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/crendon213wp/master_stripo_file.git
Set-Location "master_stripo_file"
```

## 2. Create your private settings file

The repository includes `.env.example`. It is a form. Your job is to make the real file.

From the `master_stripo_file` directory, copy it to `.env`.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### Windows Command Prompt

```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

### macOS or Linux

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env`. Replace both placeholder values:

```env
STRIPO_PLUGIN_ID=your-real-stripo-plugin-id
STRIPO_SECRET_KEY=your-real-stripo-secret-key
```

Use the credentials supplied by Stripo. Then save the file.

Do not upload `.env` to GitHub. It contains private credentials. The `.gitignore` file is already set up to keep it out of Git. Commit `.env.example`, not `.env`.

## 3. Install the dependencies

Run this from the `master_stripo_file` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads the packages the app needs. One command. No ceremony.

## 4. Start the app

```bash
npm start
```

Open this address in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Leave the terminal running while you use the editor.

## 5. Check the connection

The browser asks your local server for a Stripo token:

```text
GET http://localhost:3000/api/stripo/token
```

Your local server then asks Stripo to create the token. Your Stripo Secret Key stays on the server. That is where it belongs.

The **New Project** button uses this endpoint:

```text
POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects
```

New projects are created in a sibling directory beside the cloned repository:

```text
<parent-directory>\<project-name>
```

They are not created inside `master_stripo_file`.

## Save and reopen a project

1. Click **New Project** to create a project and save the current design.
2. Continue editing in Stripo.
3. Click **Save** to write the current HTML and CSS to that project.
4. Use the project selector and click **Open** to reopen a saved project later.

Project content is stored in a `template.json` file inside the project directory. This is local filesystem storage, not a database or browser cache. Keep the project directory backed up if the work matters.

## Troubleshooting

### The server says credentials are missing

Check these four things:

1. The file is named `.env`.
2. The file is inside `master_stripo_file`.
3. `STRIPO_PLUGIN_ID` has a real Plugin ID.
4. `STRIPO_SECRET_KEY` has a real Secret Key.

Restart the server after changing `.env`.

### Port 3000 is already being used

Use another port in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PORT=3001
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

### The New Project button reports an error

Make sure:

- The server is running from `master_stripo_file`.
- The parent directory is writable.
- You are not trying to create a project with a name that already exists.

## Keep the keys safe

- Never put the Secret Key in browser code.
- Never commit `.env`.
- Use HTTPS, authentication, and rate limiting before making the app public.
- This setup is designed for local development.
